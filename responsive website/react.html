	<h1 align="center" ><u>WHAT IS REACT</u></h1>
	<div class="yo">
	<p><h2>React is the most popular JavaScript front-end framework in use today. It’s used by both established companies and new startups.

	React was released by Facebook in 2013, and they still use it today for many of their applications.</h2></p>
	<h2>What is React used for?</h2>
	<p><h3>React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Here are three places you’ll find it being used</h3></p>
	<p><h2>Web development</h2>
	<h3>This is where React got its start and where you’ll find it used most often. React is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website. In React, you build up complete applications using components like these by nesting them.<br>

	Components in React are also reusable, which means you can use one button component for every button on your site. If you need the button to look different, you can simply change its style.<br>

	<h2>Mobile app development</h2>
	<h3>React Native is a JavaScript framework that uses React. With React Native, developers can apply web-based React principles to creating mobile apps for Android and iOS. Here, React is used to connect the mobile user interface of the application to the phone’s operating system.</h3>

	<h2>Desktop app development</h2>
	<h3>Developers can also use React with Electron, another JavaScript library, to create cross-platform desktop apps. Some apps you may know about that are built with Electron include Visual Studio Code, Slack, Skype, Discord, WhatsApp, and WordPress Desktop.</h3></p></div>
